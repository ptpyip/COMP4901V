# COMP4901V: Deep Perception, Localization, and Planning for Autonomous Vehicles

## Description
This course will deliver a knowledge base for students to understand fundamentals in autonomous vehicles under large-scale contexts within deep learning, covering three core modules: <br>
1. **Perception** 
Techniques for visual understanding of images and videos captured from RGB/LiDAR cameras.
   - object recognition
   - 2D/3D detection
   - semantic/instance segmentation
   - motion and flow estimation
   - multi-task perception

1. **Localization**
    - camera and geometry models
    - stereo and monocular depth estimation
    - 3D scene reconstruction
    - visual odometry, SLAM
    - multi-sensor fusion
  
2. **Prediction and planning**
   - pedestrian/vehicle trajectory prediction
   - motion/path planning
   - reinforcement learning in self-driving.
